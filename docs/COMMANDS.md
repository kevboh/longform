# Commands in Longform

Longform provides a number of commands you may use to quickly navigate and edit your projects. Those marked as “requires editing” below require you to be actively editing a scene in your project.

| Name                             | Requires Editing | Description                                                                                                                             |

| Open Current Note’s Project      | true             | Selects your current project (or draft of project) in the Longform pane.                                                                |
| Previous Scene                   | true             | Opens the previous scene to the one you’re currently editing, if available.                                                             |
| Previous Scene at Indent         | true             | Opens the previous scene to the one you’re currently editing at the same indentation level, if available.                               |
| Next Scene                       | true             | Opens the next scene to the one you’re currently editing, if available.                                                                 |
| Next Scene at Indent             | true             | Opens the next scene to the one you’re currently editing at the same indentation level, if available.                                   |
